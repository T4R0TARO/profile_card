## My process

Planning out the how I was going to tackle the design, I knew that I would have to use a css card effect with a layout similar to a header/body/footer/ style. So I start off my project organizing my html and come up with resusable class names. 

After the html is organized I begin with some broiler plate css; base styles, custom properties, and font-style to have spacing and calling custom variables easier.

Next I position the the containers of the content to the center of the page and begin styling my css.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project tested my understanding of the concepts of flex-box and how to manipulate flex-items to behave the way we intended. 
There were various times where I would have to change an element into a flex-container in-order to positon them items to be displayed vertically or horizontally.

The syntax below targets the footer of the card in an attempt to position the flex-items to be centerd within its flex-container and to have the flex-items evenly sized and spaced. 

flex is the shorthand for flex-grow and flex-shrink and by giving the flex-items a felx: 1 the items will fill up the available space evenly and will adjust to the width of the browser. 

.card_footer .item {
``` 
    display: flex;
    flex: 1;
    height: 100px;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

```
}


### Continued development

I will continue to familiarize myself with flex-box concept. Later maybe add animation to the background img.
